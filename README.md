# Machine Learning Intro
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Statistical computer algorithms that improve automatically through data.
- Differs from traditional programming: Algorithms infer the best approach from the data itself.
- Subset of Artificial Intelligence.
- Main goals:
  - Understand problems solved by ML
  - Learn types of ML
  - Review the ML process for supervised learning

# Numpy
Python library for creating N-dimensional arrays

Faster & more efficient than Python lists

Supports broadcasting for quick function application

Built-in tools for linear algebra, statistics, trigonometry, and random numbers

Why use NumPy?

Speed & efficiency for large datasets

Easy mathematical operations on entire arrays

Core Topics

Creating Arrays

From Python lists

Using built-in NumPy functions

Generating random data

Indexing & Slicing

Access specific elements, rows, or columns

Extract subsets of data easily

Operations

Element-wise arithmetic on arrays

Universal functions (e.g., np.sqrt(), np.exp())


# Machine Learning Concepts
## Overview of Machine Learning

## 2. ML Pathway
1. Real-world problem/question
2. Collect & store data
3. Clean & organize data
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Build ML models:
   - **Supervised Learning**: Predict outcomes
   - **Unsupervised Learning**: Discover patterns
6. Deliver a data product/service

## 3. Why Use Machine Learning?
- Solves problems such as:
  - Credit scoring
  - Insurance risk
  - Price forecasting
  - Spam filtering
  - Customer segmentation
- Can handle complex problems like handwriting recognition and spam detection.
- **Key requirement**: Good quality data.
- Most time spent on data cleaning/organization, not algorithm coding.

## 4. Types of Machine Learning
### Supervised Learning
- Uses **historical, labeled data** to predict a value.
- Two types:
  1. **Classification**: Predict categories (e.g., spam vs. not spam, tumor type)
  2. **Regression**: Predict continuous values (e.g., prices, loads, scores)

### Unsupervised Learning
- Uses **unlabeled data** to discover patterns (e.g., clustering customers by behavior).
- Harder to evaluate performance without known “correct” answers.

## 5. Supervised ML Process
1. **Collect & prepare data**  
   - Separate into **Features (X)** and **Label (y)**
2. **Split data** into:
   - Training set
   - Test set
3. **Train model** on training set
4. **Evaluate model** on test set
5. **Adjust hyperparameters** if needed
6. **Repeat** training & evaluation until performance is acceptable
7. **Deploy model** for real-world use

## 6. Example: House Price Prediction
- Features: Area, Bedrooms, Bathrooms
- Label: Price
- ML model learns feature importance from historical sales data to predict future prices.

- **Book**: *Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISLR)*
  - Free online
  - Written for R, but math concepts apply to all languages
